# First draft of task list. 

# Taken by skimming the RHEL 5 STIG. My assumption is that we
# can go over the list and improve it. Possibly more or fewer 
# groupings, or sub-groupings. Tasks should be big enough to 
# solve the problem and small enough to not include the 
# kitchen sink.

# Once the groups are defined we need to associate 
# IDs (V, CVE, GENID, etc) to a task. That way someone can look
# up an ID and see which group deals with it.
