# First draft of task list. 

# Taken by skimming the RHEL 5 STIG. My assumption is that we
# can go over the list and improve it. Possibly more or fewer 
# groupings, or sub-groupings. Tasks should be big enough to 
# solve the problem and small enough to not include the 
# kitchen sink.

# Once the groups are defined we need to associate 
# IDs (V, CVE, GENID, etc) to a task. That way someone can look
# up an ID and see which group deals with it. 

# I would recommend utilizing the power of Hiera and Facter as it 
# pertains to Puppet here.  You can leverage lookups to determine
# what compliance you're actually doing, and then do conditionals
# based on the results of those lookups.  
#
# So, while each grouping below is good, by having an array of 
# "supported compliances" passed back into Puppet, you can 
# compile the total of all things you need to support within the
# below list automatically.  I haven't fully fleshed out the 
# hierarchy in my head yet, but I think this has promise on the 
# Puppet side.
