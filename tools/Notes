1. There's an odd UTF issue on V-827, they seem to have some things odd around the
   "+" character in the title but not the text. For some reason this would not
   process on my home machine. Just edited it and things work.

2. Still have to munge the first three lines of the actual U_* STIGs to avoid XML
   issues. It could easly be my script, but feel free to help out. When the open_stig.rb
   script is run against the actual STIG, there is no output. When I turn the first
   three lines into one:
      <Benchmanrk>
   then things work.
