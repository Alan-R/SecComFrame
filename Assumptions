SecComFrame is written for the system administrator (SA) who is required to meet formal complaince guide-lines. Often, those SAs do not have extensive security training or a degree in computer science. 

They often have tools allowed/dictated at their site. These tools could be:

1. Shell scripts
2. Puppet
3. Ansible
4. Chef
5. Salt
6. etc...etc...etc...

Often those SAs use an ITIL style deployment process. That is, changes are detailed out before they are made and each one must go through a formal approval process. This process can take days or weeks, depending on the site's requirements. 

Commercial vendors may wish to sell products to those sites. Thus they may have a faster deployment process and wish to ensure their products work on a compliant system. 

Openness in code helps sites review and approve SecComFrame for their site.
