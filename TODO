TODO List
=========

1. Import relevant Aqueduct scripts
   a.  Note sent to Bill C.
   b.  Note sent to Maura D.
   c.  Note sent to Vincent P.

2. Work on repository structure.
   a.  See proposed idea in file layout_by_task.txt
   b.  I've (lh) put stuff in the tasks/audit directory as an example.

3. Coding Style Guide
   a.  See docs/coding_style_guide.txt.

4. License (Must include "free" and "use at your own risk")

5. General assumptions for contributors.

6. Links to other information.
   a.  Have the docs/ directory for this.

7. Initial target list.
   a.  RHEL 5 and 6 with Puppet and Shell. 
   b.  Others as developers come along.
   c.  RHEL 7 should/may be similar so we'll be a few bits ahead.
   d.  This should also work on OEL and SLES, for the most part.
       1. Is there a reason not to use "osfamily" for decision trees?
   f.  Oracle seems to have put out good puppet content for Sol 11.
      
8. Do we want to use tools that do not come with the OS, for development?
   a. I would prefer to have an on-disk equivalent to jsonlint.org.
   b. A tool for code coverage would be nice.
   c. The issue is that some tools require later versions of things Puppet uses,
      thus we'd run the risk of making something that doesn't work on our target
      operating systems. 
   d. Which boils down to needed a dev/test environment that is not the dev workstation. 
      1. AWS instances for test runs?
      2. AWS instance for the puppet server(s)?
      3. Other options?
