# SecComFrame

Security Compliance Framework
=============================

The Security Compliance Framework (SecComFrame) is a direct descendant of 
the Aqueduct project. Which itself grew from Bastille Linux. 

SecComFrame's goal is simple: a set of tools to secure a Linux/Unix system
according to industry guidelines. We specifically write for those who are
not security experts. The tools provided are Open Source, in that you can 
modify them to meet your site's specific needs.
