Coding Style Guide
==================

1. Puppet
   a.  Puppet Code will adhere to style via puppet-lint.  
   b.  Puppet Style guide can be found here: 
         https://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/style_guide.html
   c.  Puppet Lint Implementation can be found here:
         http://puppet-lint.com
   d.  Puppet Vim plugins to adhere to style guide can be found here:
         https://github.com/rodjek/vim-puppet
   e.  Puppet modules should have rspec tests
         http://rspec-puppet.com/

2. Shell
   a.  Shell code will adhere to Bourne shell constructs
       as much as possible. This keeps the code portable.
   b.  Use functions. Keep them in a sourced file. 
   
3. Documentation
   a.  I (lh) am not sure we want to document every VULNID in
       every bit of code. 
   b.  We do need some way to say "Problem X is fixed in Y."

4. Tests
   a.  While still a testing newbie (lh), I'm convinced we should
       have tests for our tasks. 
   b.  This could be serverspec or similar. 
   c.  While OpenSCAP is a great tool, I don't want to have to run
       it every time we try something.
   d.  That said, I do want to track code coverage and remediation 
       percentages for each tool and task.
