There are several "blank.txt" files laying around. For some reason git
doesn't want to push up an empty directory so the blank.txt file is 
there to keep the tree intact.

... For manifests that don't have a template, for instance, the directory is completely unnecessary.  Do we wish to have them there whether needed or not?  --JMS
