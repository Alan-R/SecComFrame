There are several "blank.txt" files laying around. For some reason git
doesn't want to push up an empty directory so the blank.txt file is 
there to keep the tree intact.

... For manifests that don't have a template, for instance, the directory is completely unnecessary.  Do we wish to have them there whether needed or not?  --JMS

... My first answer is "yeah", based on wanting a "new task" script that lays down all
"the normal stuff" for your tree. In my mind, having a "spec" directory reminds me that
I need to be writing tests.

In truth, we can probably do without unused directories when a module is "ready for production". 
During the initial development phase does it hurt to keep them there, just in case?
