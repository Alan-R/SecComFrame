# Proposed layout by task. 

# Issues it solves:
# 1. Different operating systems require different tasks.
# 2. Different versions of the *same* OS use different STIG finding IDs.
# 3. A site can implement a task at a time.
# 4. Within the tool subsection of the task, the tool's best practices can
#    be observed. That is, under accounts/puppet is a standard Puppet 
#    module called accounts. That module can be pulled in to Forge.mil, 
#    Puppetlabs forge, or a site's own $module_path. 
# 5. "By task" seems a bit more stable and identifiable than GENID or CVE. 
# 5.1. Admitting that there will be some size differences in tasks. 
# 5.2. Not sure exactly how many tasks yet. Maybe 75-100?
# 6. People can contribute in areas they prefer.

# Problems it causes:
# 1. Harder to just pull in just the "Tool X" content. 
# 2. Coding discipline needed for different tools to be supported
#    at the same level.


# Hypothetical tree layout.
